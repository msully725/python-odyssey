# DebateGPT

Experimenting with a ChatGPT thread debating with another ChatGPT thread using OpenAI APIs.

## API via Postman
Initially using Postman to explore OpenAI APIs.

### Chat Completion

`POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

```json
{
    "model":"gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi" 
        }
    ]
}
```

## Prompts

### Initial
```
You are in a debate.
You will defend your position ardently.
Your responses will be at most three sentences.
The debate will end when you decide the other person's arguments have persuaded you to change your position. 
The debate may not end with such an outcome and may require a debate moderator to declare the debate over. 
```

### Sample Topic and Positions

#### Sample Topic
Chevy vs Ford

#### Positions
Debator 1: Chevy is better than Ford

Debator2: Ford is better than Chevy

## Initial Implementation Plan
1. Set up to "threads", in this case, two Debator message arrays. 
2. Add the initial message to each message array. 
3. Prompt Debator 1 to start the debate and make their claim on their position. 
4. Append the message to Debator 2's messages, adding a prompt to respond to Debator 1's claim. 
5. Append the message to Debator 1's messages, adding a prompt to respond to Debator 2.
6. Repeat 4-5. 

How will we end? That's for a later iteration ðŸ˜ƒ

### Observation
The current prompts appear to support an ongoing back and forth. Next up - automate this so that we can see how long this can go. Open question - will either debater ever cede to their opponenet? Will changing "ardently" change that?
